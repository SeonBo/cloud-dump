#####  Question 57
A programmer is developing a Node.js application which will run in a Linux server on their on-premises data center. This application will access various Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services using OCI SDKs.
What is the secure way to access OCI services with OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM)?

B. Create an OCI IAM policy with the appropriate permissions to access the required OCI services and assign the policy to the on-premises Linux server.
C. Create a new OCI IAM user, add the user to a group associated with a policy that grants the desired permissions to OCI services. In the on-premises Linux server, generate the keypair used for signing API requests and upload the public key to the IAM user.
D. Create a new OCI IAM user, add the user to a group associated with a policy that grants the desired permissions to OCI services. In the on-premises Linux server, add the user name and password to a file used by Node.js authentication.
